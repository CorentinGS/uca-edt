# uca-edt

A simple tool to generate a schedule for the UCA's students.

## Environment

This project needs to include the following .env file:

```
MONGO_URL="mongodb://root:password@ip:port"
SECURITY_KEY="your_secret_key"
```

## Admin endpoint 

The admin endpoint is available at `/admin` and is protected by a basic auth. The secret key is defined in the .env file as `SECURITY_KEY`.
To access the admin endpoint, you need to provide the key as an HTTP header: `Key: your_secret_key`.

We might change this in the future to use a more secure authentication method (like JWT) but for now, this is the easiest way to do it, and it might be enough for our needs.
If you have any suggestion, feel free to open an issue or a PR.
